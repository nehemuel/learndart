void main() {

  // Please ignore or forget about comments for this class.
  
  // Really as a computer programmer all you're doing is just figuring out which instruction should I give the computer and what order should put them in. 

  // The execution flow of the computer:

  print("   /|");
  print("  / |");
  print(" /  |");
  print("/___|");

  // When the computer goes and executes a dart program it starts in the main function and then what it's going to do is it's going to go down and executed each line of code individually.

  // So the order you put these instructions in, the order you write your code is very very important thing. 

  // As you get better at programming and as you start writing more and more code it's gonna start to get really messy if you don't format and order your code.
